            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
            <p>In software architecture, there may be many layers between the hardware and end user. The front is an abstraction, simplifying the underlying component by providing a user-friendly interface, while the back usually handles data storage and
                business logic.</p><br>
            <p> In telecommunication, the front can be considered a device or service, while the back is the infrastructure that supports provision of service.</p><br>
            <p> A rule of thumb is that the client-side (or "frontend") is any component manipulated by the user. The server-side (or "backend") code usually resides on the server, often far removed physically from the user.</p><br>

                code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization..</p><br>

            <p>The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.</p>
